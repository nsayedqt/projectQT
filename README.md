this repository is for Yuval's team to develop their automation for the bench project on QT website. Good luck.

Some things required for the selenium automation as of 10/28/16:

1) A Java IDE (I'm using Eclipse Java Neon).

2) Selenium installed and the latest JAR file added to your 'libraries' tab in the Java Build Path.

3) Chrome Driver, since I am running the tests through Chrome (although selenium works with other browsers like FireFox and IE too)

4) TestNG - testing framework I am currently using.
